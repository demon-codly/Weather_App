## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Markup for the app layout

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – API interaction and dynamic rendering
- **[WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)** – For fetching real-time weather data

---

## 🧭 Navigation

The project includes the following core sections:

- `index.html` – Main HTML page
- `style.css` – Stylesheet for UI layout
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic to handle search and API fetch
- `README.md` – This documentation

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User types a location into the search field.
2. JavaScript captures the input and sends a request to WeatherAPI.
3. Weather data (temperature, condition, time, etc.) is returned.
4. The UI updates dynamically with the latest weather information.
